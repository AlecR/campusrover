#### Lab

We have a small Robotics Teaching Lab in Volen 136. In order to gain access and receive a key, there are a number of expectations and requirements that you need to be aware of and agree to.

* Our Lab is right next door to other professors' offices. Please keep your voices down. The last thing we want is to get complaints from neighboring offices that the noise is a problem.

* We are storing valuable computers and things in the lab. **PLEASE KEEP IT LOCKED** when you leave.

* You may use the lab whenever you want, to code, brainstorm, collaborate with others in the course. You would have to bring your own computer etc.

* At this point we don't know yet exactly how we will use the lab, So please help us figure out the best layout of the lab for most productivity, and also what kind of supplies or equipment we might want to get.

* Before you leave the lab, please make sure you leave it **exactly** the way you found it, in terms of layout, trash etc. Please be responsible, professional, adult citizens, and treat the lab accordingly.

#### Robots

We have invested significant part of our budget to buy the equipment and some of it is delicate. Have you ever heard of the expression "to smoke test"? It is used when programming a big system to write a test script that basically sees if the system is working. But it comes from the hardware world, when someone connects wires the wrong way, and turn the robot and smoke comes out. That's never a good sign!

##### TurtleBot3

You can do almost everything you need to using the various similators for TB3. So always do your development and testing in the simulators. But when you are working with the actual Robots you are asked to scrupulously follow the following rules of the road. For the protection of the robot as much as anything!

* You should use either of the two TurtleBot3s only with supervision from Pito, Alex or Tim
* The robot should not be taken out of the lab for any reason
* You should not touch, connect or disconnect any wires or sensors. This should be done only with and by Tim Hebert.
* When driving the robot, only the students directly doing the testing should be inside the marked off driving range. Observers and kibbitsers are fine but they should stand outside the marked off range.

##### MBot

These robots are smaller and cheaper so we can be a bit more relaxed with them.

* You may get to be the **custodian** of an mBot which means you are able to take it home with you.
* If you have problems with it Tim Hebert in the Maker Lab is super helpful.
* However you should make very sure that the mBot in your custody is not damaged in any way due to your (or your friends, roommates or strangers) carelessness or negligence.


#### Changes to rules

These are our initial stab at these rules. As we get into the course we will add and delete info here.

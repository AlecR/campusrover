* **What do we learn?** You will become very knowledgable about mobile robotics in general and the Robot Operating System in particular, Mobile Robotics is a very hot and interesting area (the Boston area is the silicon valley of robotics). It is the area of robotics that deals with robots that move around. (For example, the ones that build cars don’t move around, but the ones that deliver packages do.) The problems of Mobile Robotics are: Localization (where am I), Navigation (how do I get to where I need to be), Planning and operation (how do I do what I need to do.) We will tackle each of these in the class.

* **When, where and how?** The class meets on Wednesdays, two times. Once we have a normal “class” with some lecture and a lot of discussion and then again, in the evening, for pure lab work. There will be a maximum of 12 students. It will feel more like a lab or a startup than a class. A lot of self-study, independent work, self-management.

* **How does the class work?** The first several weeks we learn how to program our Robots with ROS, the Robot Operating System. There will be a lot of hands-on coding and experimenting during that period. Then we break into teams of 3 or 4 students, each focused on a high level goal. The team gets to figure out just how to achieve that goal. We have weekly discussions where each team is required to demonstrate what they built last week, and each team proposes their plan and demo for the next week. A kind of modified scrum.

* **What is the Robotics Lab?** We have a Robot lab where we will hold the class, and that you will have access to 24x7. It is where the Robots live so if you need to do live testing that’s where you will do it. The lab is in the basement of GZang in the area labeled “Science Library” that has been unused for quite a while. 

* **What language do we work in?** What is ROS? ROS is a very cool distributed operating system that runs on as a layer top of Linux. It’s pretty complicated and we will be spending a lot of time with it. Our programming will mostly be in Python although C++ is also there if you prefer it. It is by far the most common environment for robotics software used in academia and the commercial world. In case you end up working with Robots in the future you can almost count on it being with ROS.

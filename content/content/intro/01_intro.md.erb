title: Introduction
---
In this course we will be working with Robots. We will be taking steps toward a long term, very difficult goal, which is the <%= link_to_intro :campus_rover %>. It will not be finished in one semester! During this first, experimental semester we will be taking the first steps on the journey.

We will learn many fundamentals of building a self-driving robots, and we will actually implement a basic robot. But as importantly we will be working in a way that allows us to pass our work and results to the next group of students who continue next semester. So we will try to follow practices and techniques of code design, documentation, and testing so that the next group will have a solid base to build further.

##### Pilot Course
This is an experimental course. You will learn that it is part of a bigger idea, and that many details will be worked out with your help as a the alpha testers of the course. Your work, thinking and input will all affect the course in fundamental ways!

##### Admission
This course is a "structured independent study." We will accept up to 8 students, with some restrictions. You need to be a Junior or above, and have done well in Cosi 11a and Cosi12b and have a proven aptitude as a programmer, independent worker, and goot team member. If you want to apply, just send an email to me pitosalas@brandeis.edu.

##### Independent Study
You will be given a general direction to go, and a series of intermediate goals, but you will be studying and working mostly indpependently (or in small teams). We will supply you the robots to work with, and other required hardware and space, but it will truly be up to you to learn on your own.

##### Team Work
Much of the work will be in teams. Some of the steps will have teams of 2 or so students, but the bigger ones will have teams of 5 or maybe even all students together.

* mBot programming for solving a maze, with block walls, underway.
* Complete as many of the mBot tutorials as you are planning to look at
* <%= link_to_section :projects, :ros_immersion %>: Begin working through the first chapters of the book and doing the two C tutorials

#### Plan for meeting
* Standups and demos
* Is slack a good way to communicate? Are you seeing my posts? Am I speaking into a paper bag? Remember we are an 8 person team, lets help each other by posting our findings
* Lab notebook format: is it workable? Do you want to make your lab notebooks public? Should we make them part of the web site? Do you all know git and github?
* Look at <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %>
* Look at <%= link_to_project :ros_immersion %>

### Week 4: Sep 20

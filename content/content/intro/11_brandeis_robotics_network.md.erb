title: Brandeis Robotics Network

I have heard that the Boston Area is the "Silicon Valley" of Robotics. I haven't been able to verify that independently, but we are definitely up there. 

As Brandeis ramps up our Robotics program we are actively connecting with Industry players in the Boston area. These include startups and established companies as well as robotics researchers and associations to join us.

Below some of them!

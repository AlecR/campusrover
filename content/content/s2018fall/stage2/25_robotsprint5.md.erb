#### Standups and Demos
* Each team goes through their standups and demonstrations

#### Navigation Team: Roger, Sam, Jonathan

* Jonathan will be researching fiducials and investigating their reliability, visibility, and how viable of a localization strategy they will be.
* Sam will be researching the ability of Ros to import a floor plan and/or campus map for the robot to use during localization and navigation.
* Roger will be working with the architecture team to dissect turtlebot 2's move_base and in figuring out how to rewire the nav stack to take teleop input without stopping the turtlebot's localization.

##### Goals

* Research and have a plan for where we are going with fiducials
* Have begun the process of connecting the navigation stack to the architecture

##### Demos

* A presentation of this week's research along with a conclusion and next step on the researched topics (fiducials, maps)
* A joint deliverable with the architecture team on the teleop override and localization continuity

#### Architecture Team: Nishan, Nick, Alec

##### Goals

* Our goal for this week is to merge our work with the navigation team and explore switching between autonomous navigation and teleop control.
* We will look into how the navigation team is accomplishing localization and navigation.
* If the two can be separated, we can allow localization to continue while teleop takes control over navigation.
* If they can't be easily separated we will have to explore alternatives.
* The three of us are meeting with Roger from Navigation tomorrow morning. We'll have a better idea of how to break up our work for the week then.

##### Demos

* Our deliverables this week will be a presentation on what we learned about switching between autonomous navigation and teleop control and how we solved any challenges.
* If we are able to get it working on the robot we will do a quick demo.


#### New Platform Team: Michael, Hunter, Aaron

##### Goals
* order the new Turtlebot Burger
* start researching how the OpenCR board talks to the dynamixel motors.
* We will work on the robots we have available while the parts are shipped.

##### Demos

1. A list of commands and communication methods that the dynamixel motor Burger uses with the OpenCR board. (Hunter and Mike)
2. Specs/hardware list for the TurtleBot 3 Waffle in terms of dimensions and implementation using Burger parts and progress in obtaining them. (Aaron)

#### Topics To cover
* Final Reports
* Demo Day

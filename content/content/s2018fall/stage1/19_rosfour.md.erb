1. **Book**: Read Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12. Write a program based on what you learned there that does something interesting. This should be an original program and you will be asked to submit the code as well as an explanation of the goal you set for yourself.

1. **Programming: Maze** Please continue and really complete: <%= link_to_topic :hw_ros_maze %>. Note that this is a team assignment, which means that you should work together with your teammates and have a single deliverable. It's important that you actually collaborate. Getting comfortable with your teammates and sorting out how to divide up the work will continue to be important.

1. **Projects**: Review the description of Mark 1 here: <%= link_to_intro :campus_rover %>. Add at least 2 items to the underlying steps that you think would be interesting to work on.

cat: lab
desc: Every student writes their own version of a pair of nodes. Teams work on roomba tour code

#### Lab work
* Using two TB3s. Random teams.
* On your own computers, install TB3 software
* In ~/catkin_ws/src git clone rosbook: https://github.com/campusrover/rosbook
* Individually, in the emulator, run red_light_green_light.py and wander.py
* Make some modifications to them and run them in the emulator
* Try running them on a real robot
* Write a new program which has a robot drive through an area surrounded by walls, and act something like a variation on a roomba. That is to say, it drives around until it comes within 30cm of an obstacle, rotates in place, and continues in a new direction. You can elaborate this any way you like. The challenge beyond just getting it to work, is to make sure it doesn't get stuck somewhere. See how robust you can make it.

1. **Programming: Maze** Please do [Programming Assignment 2: Mazes2](https://github.com/campusrover/cosi119a-homeworks/raw/master/CS119aPA2.pdf). Note that this is a team assignment, which means that you should work together with your teammates and have a single deliverable. It's important that you actually collaborate. Getting comfortable with your teammates and sorting out how to divide up the work will continue to be important.
1. **Podcast** Listen to this good podcast episode: [Self Driving Cars and Deep Learning](http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/SelfDrivingDeepLearning.mp3)

### Lab Meeting
* We are meeting at 9:00 in the Robotics Lab near my office and will walk from there to where we have the maze set up.

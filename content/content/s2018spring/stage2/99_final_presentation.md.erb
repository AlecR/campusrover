* Any students who are intertested

##### Agenda

1. Pito welcomes and introduces the course and the team
1. Basic demo in the room of the robot doing something fun
1. Each team does a technical presentation of about 15 minutes, taking questions
1. More extensive demo with the robot going outside the room (into the hall)
1. Close with a video of the robot going on an adventure elsehwere on campus

#### Preparation

##### Technical requirements

* New platform working reliably
  * drives around with teleop
  * working 3d Camera
  * workings slam
  * some visually interesting features, for example a series of lights, a moving camera arm, etc
  * some auditory interesting feature like a horn or a speaker
* Mobile UI on a smartphone
  * May be Web
  * Solid enough to let a visitor try it
  * Includes some trivial authentication (like a single fixed password)
* Internals
  * Working with new architecture


##### Excellent presentation

* **Technical Level**: Aim for this to be fairly technical. Even though we will have a somewhat lay audience, We want  to challenge them and ourselves by giving a technically interesting presentation. Be ready to show diagrams and key code or pseudo code. Talk about specific ROS modules, challenges, insights etc. Show code.
* **Coordinated:** We want to coordinate the three presentations so they are not repetitive and so they tell a whole story. The coordination should also connect the work we've done with the overall "CampusRover" concept.
* **Demo**: Each team needs to do a well rehearsed and tested demo. The demo needs to work and tie into the overall vision.

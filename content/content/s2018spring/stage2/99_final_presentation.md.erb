##### Event

* Tentative Date: May 7, 10:00am to 12:00pm
* Tentative Location: TBD

##### Guests
* We will have two representatives from Amazon Robotics
* We will have one or more faculty members (Brandeis)
* Charlie Squires
* Any students who are intertested

##### Agenda

1. Pito welcomes and introduces the course and the team
1. Live Robot Demo (see below)
1. Each team does a technical presentation of about 15 minutes, taking questions
1. More extensive demo with the robot going outside the room (into the hall)
1. Close with a video of the robot going on an adventure elsehwere on campus

#### Preparation

##### Live Robot Demo

* Web control of robot includes:
  * List of way points
  * Camera Video
  * Commands to teleop
  * Commands to activate Robot Peripherals
* New platform RObot working
  * Including a 3D Camera
  * Possibly new motors
* Demo:
  * Summon the robot to a point
  * Command it to go to another point
  * It avoids obstacles
  * Use teleop to go somewhere it's not been before

##### Technical requirements

* New platform working reliably
  * drives around with teleop
  * working 3d Camera
  * workings slam
  * some visually interesting features, for example a series of lights, a moving camera arm, etc
  * Robot peripherals: horn or siren or LCD display or some moving arm
* Mobile UI on a smartphone
  * Web based
  * Solid enough to let a visitor try it
  * Might include some trivial authentication (like a single fixed password, but not important.)
* Internals
  * Working with new architecture


##### Excellent presentation

* **Technical Level**: Aim for this to be fairly technical. Even though we will have a somewhat lay audience, We want  to challenge them and ourselves by giving a technically interesting presentation. Be ready to show diagrams and key code or pseudo code. Talk about specific ROS modules, challenges, insights etc. Show code.
* **Coordinated:** We want to coordinate the three presentations so they are not repetitive and so they tell a whole story. The coordination should also connect the work we've done with the overall "CampusRover" concept.
* **Demo**: Each team needs to do a well rehearsed and tested demo. The demo needs to work and tie into the overall vision. They may use different robots to avoid having to switch over one robot to other modes.

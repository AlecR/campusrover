<%= callout("NB", " Don't us generic ROS installation instructions, follow ones specific to the Turtlebot3. See our ROS Install page.") %>

We will be using two kinds of hardware. **See <%= link_to_background :ros_install %>**

#### Hardware

1. During the first stage we will be using the [mBot Robot](http://store.makeblock.com/mbot-v1-1-stem-educational-robot-kit) from [Makeblock](http://learn.makeblock.com/en/software/).

1. During the latter stage of the course we will be using the [TurtleBot3](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info). This is a far more sophisticated beast (also more expensive!)

#### Software

1. The robotics software that is used by the turtlebot3 is ROS, version "Kinetic".

1. The Linux version used on your own computer for using ROS is Ubutnu 16.04

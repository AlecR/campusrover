desc: Localization and Navigation are the core of mobile robotics!

#### Localization
* How does the Robot "know" where it is?
* How does it determine it's "pose"?
* Relative to a coordiante system
* Could be GPS coordinates
* But more likely coordiantes of a given map

##### Localizing the Robot on a map
* Key package is called `amcl` - Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization
* It's a deep theoretical area covered in *Probabilistic Robotics by Sebsastian Thrun, et al*

##### How it works at a heigh level
* Location of robot is its **pose**
* Always known with respect to a **map coordiante frame** (also called sometimes the *world coordinate frame*)
* `amcl` maintains a set of *candidate poses* plus a probability that they reflect reality
* As robot moves, actual sensor readings are compared with expected sensor readings for each pose, and the probability of each candidate pose can be updated.
* Low probability poses are discarded, and high probability poses are updated based on odometry, scan, and probability.
* For path planning purposes the highest probability pose is used.
* It is definitely a *guess* not a certainty.

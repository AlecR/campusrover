title: "9: Building Maps"

#### Maps in ROS
* Our focus is mobile, ground based robots
* In ROS maps are represented as a 2d grid
* Each dot in the grid corresponds to a square in the real world (based on the resulution of the map)
  * Black dots: walls (not passable)
  * White dots: open space (passable)
  * Grey dots: Unknown
* Maps in fact are stored as images - .png, .jpg, .pgm
* You can edit them in any appropraite image editing tool
* Accompanying YAML file defines mapping between image and real world
* Map = *.png + *.yaml
* example:

<%= code_begin %>
image: map.pgm
resolution: 0.1
origin: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196
negate: 1
<%= code_end %>

* Definitions:
  * image: filename
  * resolution: in meters, how large a square in the real world does one pixel represent 
  * origin: What is the real world coordinate of the pixel in the [0,0] position
  * occupied_thresh: pixels with color value greater than this number are considered occupied
  * free_thresh: pixels with color value less than this number are considered free. (Values in between are considered unknown)
  * negate: Depending on whether black is 1 or black is 0 in the image representation, it might have to be negated

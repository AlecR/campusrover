title: Robot Safety Plan
---
We have invested significant part of our budget to buy the equipment and some of it is delicate. Have you ever heard of the expression "to smoke test"? It is used when programming a big system to write a test script that basically sees if the system is working. But it comes from the hardware world, when someone connects wires the wrong way, and turn the robot and smoke comes out. That's never a good sign!

#### TurtleBot3

You can do almost everything you need to using the various similators for TB3. So always do your development and testing in the simulators. But when you are working with the actual Robots you are asked to scrupulously follow the following rules of the road. For the protection of the robot as much as anything!

* You should use either of the two robots only with supervision from Pito, Alex or Tim
* The robot should not be taken out of the lab for any reason
* You should not touch, connect or disconnect any wires or sensors. This should be done only with and by Tim Hebert.
* When driving the robot, only the students directly doing the testing should be inside the marked off driving range. Observers and kibbitsers are fine but they should stand outside the marked off range.

#### MBot
These robots are smaller and cheaper so we can be a bit more relaxed with them.

* An mBot will be assigned to each team of two students who agree to each take full responsibility for their health and safety
* You may sign them out of the lab with the approval of Pito. We will supply a handy carrier so that they are protected in transit.

#### Changes to rules

These are our initial stab at these rules. As we get into the course we will add and delete info here.

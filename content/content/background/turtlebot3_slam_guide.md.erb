title: Running SLAM on Turtlebot3
desc: A guide to mapping with SLAM and using autonomous navigation

#### Introduction

In robotics, SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a powerful algorithm for creating a map which can be used for autonomous navigation. When working with SLAM on the Turtlebot3, the `Turtlebot3_slam` package provides a good starting point for creating a map. Although this package does provide preconfigured launch files for using SLAM, there are parameters that can be tuned in order to improve performance. This guide will explain how to tune these parameters and how to use SLAM on the Turtlebot3.

#### Getting Started

To work with SLAM, the `Turtlebot3_slam` package is necessary. To prepare the robot for running SLAM, start up the Turtlebot3 with the `Turtlebot3_robot.launch` file. There are a variety of methods that can be used with SLAM, and for this guide we will use `gmapping` to create our map.

#### Tuning SLAM parametres

To get the most out of `Turtlebot3_slam`, some tuning of parameters in the launch file is required. To tune the parameters, open the `Turtlebot3_gmapping.launch file` and modify it to look like the following:

```
<launch>
  <!-- Arguments -->
  <arg name="model" default="$(env TURTLEBOT3_MODEL)" doc="model type [burger, waffle, waffle_pi]"/>
  <arg name="configuration_basename" default="turtlebot3_lds_2d.lua"/>
  <arg name="set_base_frame" default="base_footprint"/>
  <arg name="set_odom_frame" default="odom"/>
  <arg name="set_map_frame"  default="map"/>

  <!-- Gmapping -->
  <node pkg="gmapping" type="slam_gmapping" name="turtlebot3_slam_gmapping" output="screen">
    <param name="base_frame" value="$(arg set_base_frame)"/>
    <param name="odom_frame" value="$(arg set_odom_frame)"/>
    <param name="map_frame"  value="$(arg set_map_frame)"/>
    <param name="map_update_interval" value="0.5"/>
    <param name="maxUrange" value="3.0"/>
    <param name="sigma" value="0.05"/>
    <param name="kernelSize" value="1"/>
    <param name="lstep" value="0.05"/>
    <param name="astep" value="0.05"/>
    <param name="iterations" value="5"/>
    <param name="lsigma" value="0.075"/>
    <param name="ogain" value="3.0"/>
    <param name="lskip" value="0"/>
    <param name="minimumScore" value="50"/>
    <param name="srr" value="0.1"/>
    <param name="srt" value="0.2"/>
    <param name="str" value="0.1"/>
    <param name="stt" value="0.2"/>
    <param name="linearUpdate" value="1.0"/>
    <param name="angularUpdate" value="0.05"/>
    <param name="temporalUpdate" value="0.2"/>
    <param name="resampleThreshold" value="0.5"/>
    <param name="particles" value="100"/>
    <param name="xmin" value="-10.0"/>
    <param name="ymin" value="-10.0"/>
    <param name="xmax" value="10.0"/>
    <param name="ymax" value="10.0"/>
    <param name="delta" value="0.05"/>
    <param name="llsamplerange" value="0.01"/>
    <param name="llsamplestep" value="0.01"/>
    <param name="lasamplerange" value="0.005"/>
    <param name="lasamplestep" value="0.005"/>
  </node>
</launch>
```

The file above has taken the default configuration, but modified the `map_update_interval`, `linearUpdate`, and `angularUpdate` parameters. Although this may not be the optimal configuration, these parameter updates do significantly increase the map quality from the default launch file. Further expermimentation and tuning of the parameters can be done if results are not satisfactory, and a tuning guide can be found here: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam/#slam

#### Running SLAM

Now that the launch file parameters have been tuned and the Turtlebot3 is running, a map can be created with SLAM. In order to start running SLAM, the following command should be executed on the remote PC connected to roscore: `roslaunch Turtlebot3_slam Turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping`. This should bring up RViz with a view of the map being created. In order to actually create the map, teleop is necessary to drive the robot. In a separate terminal window, run `roslaunch Turtlebot3_teleop Turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch` and use the keyboard to drive the Turtlebot3 around the space. Once the area has been sufficiently mapped, the map can be saved for use in autonomously navigating.

#### Saving The Map

Once the map has been created using SLAM, it can be saved using the `map_server` package. To save a map, use the command `rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map`. The `~/map` will save the map with the name `map` to the root directory, but this can be changed by modifying the path on the end of the command. Once this has been run, the map is saved and it can be used for autonomous navigation.

#### Autonomously Navigating

After the map has been successfully saved, the SLAM node which is running can be stopped and navigation can begin. The Turtlebot3 navigation stack contains many powerful navigation algorithms which can be used without any configuration, and we will use one here. To start the navigation node, run the command `roslaunch Turtlebot3_navigation Turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml` with the correct path to your map. This file will once again launch RViz, displaying the map which was just created. Before we can navigate, the robot needs to be localized on the map, and this can be done in RViz. Using the `2D Pose Estimate` button, give the robot an estimate of where it is located on the map. Once the robot is in the correct position, a `2D Nav Goal` can be sent through RViz in the same way. With a 2D Nav Goal set, the robot should begin to navigate to the desired location.

title: Documentation and Lab Notebook
---

### Motivation

We expect that this course will be the first in a sequence, building on each other over the semesters. Therefore, documenting our work so that the next group of students can pick off where we left off is critical. This documentation will come in the form of Reports, Github code, and Lab Notebooks

#### Reports

One deliverable for each "project" is a report with the primary purpose of allowing another student to fully reproduce the result of the project, thereby relieving the next group of retracing and making all the same mistakes. The

#### Code

All final code will be posted in a github repository. The idea is to make it a professional deliverable, well documentated, including readme and good organization.

#### Lab Notebooks

A  key part of assessing students' work in this course will be examining the lab notebooks. At the end of every module, we will review the notebooks looking for: how much progress has been achieved, how clearly the work is captured. The content should be reasonably good english, and readable and understanable. However it is not treated as an essay for style, grammar and so on.

##### How to

* Each student will have an online lab notebook in the form of a single google doc. The document may be public but in any event will be shared with the instructors.

* At the end of each and every work session (or more often) students will make a dated entry, which can be of any length, and include text, pictures, links, or anything else. The entry should cover:
  * What was attempted and whether it was achieved
  * Any data collected that might be interesting for later on
  * Lessons learned if any
  * What is proposed for the next work session.

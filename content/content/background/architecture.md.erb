title: High level architecture
---

#### Assumptions
* ROS is the foundation for the architecture
* Outdoor navigation will use GPS (with help when available from April Tags)
* Indoor navigation will use April Tags
* All navigatation will go from pre-defined waypoint to pre-defined waypoint

#### Node: Planner
* This node will accept high level goals and orchestrate the motion of the robot according to these goals.
* Does it implement a ROS Action?
* Actions:
  * Go to waypoint x
  * Emergency Stop
  * Report current location
* Subscribes to:
  * /nav/obstacle
  

#### Web Interface
* Provides a bidirectional web interrface to the robot
* Runs on the robot and serves HTTP Requests
* Probably written with Python/Flask
* Requests returning html
  * / - General status
  * /cmd/emer - Emergency Stop
  * /cmd/turn/[right,left,forward] - turn
  * /cmd/move/[forward, reverse, stop] - move
* Requests returning json
  * /ask/status
  * /ask/whattosay
* Requests supplying info
  * /tell/gps?lat=xxx&long=yyy
* These requests are all independent of each other, in other words they can come in any order and as often as needed.

#### Node: Waypoint
* Suite of ROS services
* Keeps track of the waypoints and their coordinates
* Coordinate system is likely the GPS coordinate system, but not sure yet
* Services:
  * LookupWaypointByName
    * Input: name of waypoint (string)
    * Output lat and long of waypoint (two floats)
  * LookupWaypointByLatLong
    * Input: lat and long (two floats)
    * Output: list of waypoint names, including distance from target

#### Node: AprilTag Sensor
* Takes input from the onboard camera, locates April tags in image (if any)
* By analyzing the identified April Tag(s) and their known locations, this node can publish its guess of the location
* Topics:
  * /nav/TagRead
    * latlong: two floats
    * condidence: float (0-1)

  #### Node: Obstacle Avoider
  * Takes input from sensors and decides if there is an obstacle in the way.
  * Publihes information about obstacles encountered
  * Topics:
    * /nav/obstacle - how to report this?

The following list are links that you are expected to use to learn on your own. In the course schedule and other places, there will be references to these. These are in approximate priority order.

1. [Podcast about Self-Driving Deep Learning](http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/SelfDrivingDeepLearning.mp3) - Really good background about applying deep learning to autonomous navigation. Just 1 hour.

1. [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898) - This is an excellent book that introduces ROS from the bottom up. You should get a copy. Beware, ROS is pretty complicated. It's real-time, distributed operating system which is installed both on the robot and on the controlling laptop (if there is one). It can be quite difficult to configure and finnicky. But it is very very powerful!

1. The best resource we've found for using and developing software for the mBot are their own [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWfQWTxfaxo)

1. [Columbia edX Course on Robotics and ROS](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info): This is an extensive and excellent course on Robotics with ROS, the Robot Operating System. I have followed it all and found that it is helpful in many different ways. You should follow the whole thing during the first 3 weeks of the course.

1. [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373) - A fantastic introduction to the basics of SLAM and localization, doing some of the elementary mathematics that is the foundation of this core technique in navigation.

1. [MIT Self Driving Cars Course](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu) is a great online course consisting of lectures and other content. I recommend you purusing it!

1. (ROS By Example with Indigo, Vol 1 and 2)[http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/r-patrick-goebel/ros-by-example-indigo-volume-1/ebook/product-23032353.html] While this book is based on an earlier version of ROS (Indigo) it is a fantastic complement to the  [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898) book required for this course.

1. [Introduction to Navigation Using ROS](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~nardi/Didattica/CAI/matdid/robot-programming-ROS-introduction-to-navigation.pdf) - A PDF from a course from Universitt√† Di ROma, which has some excellent slides.

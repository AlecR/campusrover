The following list are links that you are expected to use to learn on your own. In the course schedule and other places, there will be references to these. These are in approximate priority order.

1. I like this overview of good [Python Style](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/). This is the [official Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

1. [Columbia edX Course on Robotics and ROS](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info): This is an extensive and excellent course on Robotics with ROS, the Robot Operating System. I have followed it all and found that it is helpful in many different ways. You should follow the whole thing during the first 3 weeks of the course.

1. [MIT Self Driving Cars Course](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu) is a great online course consisting of lectures and other content. I recommend you purusing it!

1. (ROS By Example with Indigo, Vol 1 and 2)[http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/r-patrick-goebel/ros-by-example-indigo-volume-1/ebook/product-23032353.html] While this book is based on an earlier version of ROS (Indigo) it is a fantastic complement to the  [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898) book required for this course.

1. [Introduction to Navigation Using ROS](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~nardi/Didattica/CAI/matdid/robot-programming-ROS-introduction-to-navigation.pdf) - A PDF from a course from Universitt√† Di ROma, which has some excellent slides.

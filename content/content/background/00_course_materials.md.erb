#### Required Course Text Books

1. [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898). This is an excellent book that introduces ROS from the bottom up. You should get a copy. Beware, ROS is pretty complicated. It's real-time, distributed operating system which is installed both on the robot and on the controlling laptop (if there is one). It can be quite difficult to configure and finnicky. But it is very very powerful!

1. [ROS By Example Volume 1](http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/r-patrick-goebel/ros-by-example-indigo-volume-1/ebook/product-23032353.html) This is an excellent supplement to Programming Robots with ROS. We will be doing examples from this book. I highly recommend that you get access to it.

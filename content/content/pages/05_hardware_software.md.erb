#### Hardware and Software

We will be using two kinds of hardware.

1. During the first stage we will be using the [mBot Robot](http://store.makeblock.com/mbot-v1-1-stem-educational-robot-kit) from [Makeblock](http://learn.makeblock.com/en/software/).

1. During the latter stage of the course we will be using the [TurtleBot3](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info). This is a far more sophisticated beast (also more expensive!)

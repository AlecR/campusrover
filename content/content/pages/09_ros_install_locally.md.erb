title: Local ROS Installation
---
A lot can be done running ROS on your personal laptop, without a robot. There are lots of instructions on the web about how to do this, **and I could get none of them to work**.

So far, (and I am still working on this), the best solution I've found is to install VMWare on my computer, install Ubuntu on that, and follow the instructions for installing the "remote computer" from Turtlebot3.

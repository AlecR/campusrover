title: Course Structure

### Independent Study

This experimental course is a structured independent study. We provide only a rough guide of how the semester will unfold. You will be expected to figure things out on your own in large part. It is very likely that we will not follow this very closely.

#### Grading
Because of the experimental nature of the course, and the fact that hardware is hardware, and the fact that we may discover new more interesting directions to go, your grade will partially be on your final project. But less obvious is that this course will morph as it progresses and you are expected to be part of that process, guiding, suggesting, trying and pushing. So, the other part of the grade will be based on your own commitment, inventiveness, creativity, motivation and teamwork.

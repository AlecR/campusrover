1. [Columbia edX Course on Robotics and ROS](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info): This is an extensive and excellent course on Robotics with ROS, the Robot Operating System. I have followed it all and found that it is helpful in many different ways. You should follow the whole thing during the first 3 weeks of the course.

1. [Introduction to Navigation Using ROS](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~nardi/Didattica/CAI/matdid/robot-programming-ROS-introduction-to-navigation.pdf) - A PDF from a course from Universitt√† Di ROma, which has some excellent slides.

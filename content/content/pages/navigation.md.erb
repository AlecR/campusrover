## Navigation
  * GPS will not be reliable for indoors, or where there are tall buildings
  * Also not accurate enough for our purposes
  * Use range finders + a detailed map of obstacles
  * "Simultanuous Localization and Mapping" = SLAM
  * Paper beacons (look like barcodes)

## Algorithms
  * Brushfire algorithm
  * A* algorithm
  * Dijkstra

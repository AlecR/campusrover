### Introduction

In this course we will be working with Robots. We will be taking steps toward a long term, very difficult goal, which is the <%= link_to_pages :campus_rover %>. It will not be finished in one semester! During this first, experimental semester we will be taking the first steps on the journey.

We will learn many fundamentals of building a self-driving robots, and we will actually implement a basic robot. But as importantly we will be working in a way that allows us to pass our work and results to the next group of students who continue next semester. So we will try to follow practices and techniques of code design, documentation, and testing so that the next group will have a solid base to build further.

#### Hardware

We will be using two kinds of hardware.

1. During the first stage we will be using the [mBot Robot](http://store.makeblock.com/mbot-v1-1-stem-educational-robot-kit) from [Makeblock](http://learn.makeblock.com/en/software/).

1. During the latter stage of the course we will be using the [TurtleBot3](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info). This is a far more sophisticated beast (also more expensive!)

#### Software



Operating System: Our Pi will be running Linux and "ROS" - the Robot Operating System on top of that.

Programming Language: Our primary programming language will be Python although there will be sprinklings of other languages that will be required as we go forward.

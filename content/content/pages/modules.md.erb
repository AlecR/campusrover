#### Hardware/Software integrtion
  * Get the robot up and running
  * Demonstrate this by having it traverse a one meter square path and return to exactly the same place
  * This might be done for two different candidarte platforms

#### Simple Robot Trip
  * Leave one office
  * Go down hall
  * Come into another office

#### Navigation Problem Exploration
  * Pick two faraway endpoints
  * Analyze step by step the characteristic of the path
  * Consider ground condition, indoor vs. outdoor, GPS reception, etc.
  * Report on it

#### Localization
  * Experiment with different ways for the robot to determine where it is
  * Dead Reconing
  * GPS + Compass?
  * Visual landmarks
  * Bluetooth beacons
  * Wifi triangulation
  * Do we use a cheap android phone

#### Interpersonal Aspects
  * Would allowing the robot to take voice commands be useful?
  * Can the Robot ask a bystander to open the door for them?
  * How would it be able to tell that the door had been opened?

#### Legal Aspects
  * Does the robot traversing the campus bring up legal, insurance, or other problems?

#### Robots and Society
  * Remember the original insight or idea for the robot was watching a person delivering a package
  * Will Robots drive unemployment?
  * What will be the impact of autonomous vehicles on society
  * Some interventions which promote sustaintability might adversely affect poverty.

#### SLAM
  * How does it work?
  * Can we get it to work
  * What are the inputs and outputs
  * Demonstrate it
  * How well would it work for our purposes

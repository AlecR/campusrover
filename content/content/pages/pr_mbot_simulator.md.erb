title: mBot Simulator
---
#### Intro

if you don’t have a robot it’s hard to see if your Arduino program works. As far as we know, there's no Arduino or mBot simulator to allow students to experiment without having hardware

#### Project

This project is to create an MBot emulator which runs actual Arduino code (without having an Arduino), including emulating the upload process from the Arduino IDE, and then allows the student to both test, debug and then watch the MBot drive around.

This will not require 3D rendering. What is needed is a birds-eye view looking down onto the mBot. It will require some degree of 'real world' simulation, some assumptions about the friction of the surface, the fact that motors drive at different speeds, and so on.

This project too starts with googling and looking through github and then doing some experimentation). There might be parts of this already developed that can be used for building blocks.

#### Background
We now want to write a ROS node (or nodes) to drive the robot through a maze. You will do it first in simulation and then with the TB3.

#### Learning Objectives
* Demonstrate ability to write a multi node ROS app
* Using laser distance sensor to sense maze walls
* Moving from simulated robot to actual robot

#### Reference
* ROS Book Chapter #x, y

#### Steps

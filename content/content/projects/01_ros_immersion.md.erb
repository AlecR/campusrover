#### Intro
ROS is quite complicated to get up and running, and to really understand. This is a warmup project which will allow students to really get familiar with it in a hands-on manner.

#### Learning Objectives
* Install ROS on your computer and demonstrate operation
* Write a simple example program with ROS and run in simulator
* Understanding the role and purpose of nodes, topics, commands and services
* Understanding the key components and utilities: ROSCORE, ROSTOPICS
* Ability to write and run ROS Nodes

#### Steps

1. Acquire and read the first 7 Chapters of [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898)
1. Install [TurtleBot3 ROS packages ](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/) on your Ubuntu computer. In the likely event that you don't have an Ubuntu, we have tested the way to get things up and running on either Mac or Windows: <%= link_to_topic :ros_install %>. Whatever you do **Don't try and install ROS on Mac or Windows**. It will make you sad.
1. Write and get to run the WanderBot example from the book

title: Architecture Validation
---
#### Introduction
We are embarked on defining a high level architecture for <%= link_to_section :intro, :campus_rover %>. This is a work in progress. We need to start building parts of it in skeleton form to validate and correct it. We are documenting the architecure in the [Campus Rover Architecture Wiki](https://github.com/campusrover/cosi119a-documentation/wiki).

#### Mission
* Implement the architecture in skeleton form to see if it can go together
* Correct or add details to the architecture description

title: "Project: mBot Square"

<%= callout("UNDER CONSTRUCTION!"," At this point this is an unorganized collection of notes! You may poke around to satisfy your curiosity, but there's no organization, lots of old invalid stuff, etc. Buyer Beware") %>

#### Intro
In this project your goal is to write software for the mBot robot and get it to run in a controled manner in a one meter square, ending up back to the exact spot where you began.

#### Learning Objectives
* Basics of arduino robotics
* Write code for arduino, debug it, deploy it
* Creatively address a subtle problem in location and navigation

#### Further details
* Given an mBot, you just have to figure out how to write code for it and it's arduino processor. You will do some basic web research and reading to accomplish this

* You will figure out a way to determine how to make the mBot go for a known distance. You can use dead reconning or the mBot sensor.

* You can create whatever initial conditions you want within these constraints. The robot is placed on the floor, indoors, no closer than 2 meters from any wall. It independently begins driving in any direction, for 1meter, makes 4 90 degree turns, and tries to arrive at the same spot. There will be no obstacles.

* You may use whatever sensors are on the mBot or add any sensors you can find if you think that will help. You will have a $25 budget if you need it.

#### Lab Notebook
* Record your experiments in your lab notebook

title: "iRobot: New Platform Research"
---
#### Introduction
We want to see how far we can take the [iRobot Create](http://store.irobot.com/default/create-programmable-programmable-robot-irobot-create-2/RC65099.html?cgid=us&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk4O-s5Da2AIVhrrACh22tgbAEAAYASAAEgLw1fD_BwE) + Laptop configuration. iRobot Create is basically a Roomba robotic cleaner designed for research and experimentation. We have interfaced it with a linux laptop and demonstrated basic functionality. We want to take this as far as it can go.

#### Research Question
1. **Can iRobot Create with a cheap laptop mounted on top be a reliable ROS based robot.**
1. **Can we attach two webcams and use [OpenCV](http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv) to create a depth camera (paralax)?**
1. **Can we use the depth camera data as a substitute for the Lidar?**
1. **Can we use the depth camera data with the navigation stack?**

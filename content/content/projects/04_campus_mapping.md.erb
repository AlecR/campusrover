title: "Project: Campus Mapping"
---
#### Summary
To achieve the long term goal of <%= link_to_page :campus_rover %> we will need some kind of high level map of campus. It would probably be a hierarchical structure with offices at the bottom, then hallways, floors, and outdoor routes. This project is still very rough.

#### Building blocks
* Investigate existing research and practice to addressing this part of the problem
* Summarize findings in a report
* Design the "data structure" to represent the high level map
* Probably make it externally editable and available through a REST Api from an extrinsic server

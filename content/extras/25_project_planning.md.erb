title: Project Planning

We will run in 1 week Sprints. On the day of our class (Mondays) each team is asked to meet (during class) and decide on what their deliverables will be for this Sprint, as well as what they plan to demo. Usually the deliverables will be individual but not necessarily. You can decide what makes the most sense. And the team demo can be a robot doing something but it could also be something in the simulation or a meaningful presentation about a result.

This should be cast into a brief email and sent to all the members of our lab. You can use the list of recipients above. That email should go out before midnight on Monday. It shouldn’t be any longer than this email (approx.)

The following week, we start with standup where each person states what they feel they achieved, what they are thinking for for next week, and any roadblocks that we can solve together. This is followed by the team’s demo.
